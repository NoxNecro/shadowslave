        Despite this, I still think it's fair to take his explanations for some of the 'mechanics' of the power system as the truth.

from the [discord](https://discord.gg/guiltythree) will be shown, with explanations where they are necessary. <br>

This explanation will mostly consist of explanations on ranks and classes, though there will be some quick mentions on topics such as memories, echoes and other sources of power. <br>

I'll try to minimize the amount of lore (outside of what is necessary for a full understanding of the power system, of course) I give on this page. <br><br>


## Ranks vs Classes
Ranks and Classes seem, at first glance, very similar as they both increase the power of the owner, right? Well, not quite. <br>
Let's talk about Ranks, the most complicated one, first.

### Ranks
To fully understand the concept of ranks, you need to understand that as humans/nightmare creatures grow stronger they become closer to reaching divinity/profanity respectively. <br>
The reason for this is very important to the story, and less so for a full understanding of the power system, so I'll leave it out to avoid more spoilers.<br>

For humans I'll mostly be mentioning their power in the context of the

    <strong style="cursor: pointer; text-decoration: underline dotted;">Nightmare Spell</strong>
    <span class="excerpt-popup">
        The Nightmare Spell allows humans to grow stronger through conquering Nightmares, instead of having to follow the 'ancient' path which relied on training yourself.
    </span>

as that is the way (most of) our main cast grows. <br> 

The next thing you need to understand is that the Path of Ascension is a mirror of the Path of Corruption and vice versa.

|   | Ascension           | Corruption |
|---|---------------------|------------|
| 1 | Dormant (Sleeper)   | Dormant    |
| 2 | Awakened (Awakened) | Awakened   |
| 3 | Ascended (Master)   | Fallen     |
| 4 | Transcendent (Saint)| Corrupted  |
| 5 | Supreme (Sovereign) | Great      |
| 6 | Sacred (Spirit)     | Cursed     |
| 7 | Divine (God)        | Unholy     |


<blockquote>
each step of the Path of Ascension... as well as of the Path of Corruption... has its own meaning.<br>
The first path is the ascent toward divinity, while the second is the descent into profanity." <br>
- Nephis, Chapter 1073 The Fourth Step
</blockquote>

And their own meaning they have! 

<br><br>
<blockquote>
dormant quote here
</blockquote>

Sleepers are carriers of the Nightmare Spell that have passed the First Nightmare. <br> They receive the ability to perceive and interact with Soul Cores, as well as a unique Aspect and Flaw. 

<br><br>
<blockquote>
Awakening was the first step toward divinity, after all, and divinity was in direct opposition to Corruption. <br>
So, it only made sense that coming closer to divinity would render one immune to the weaker manifestation of its enemy. <br>
- Sunny, Chapter 1827 Cleansing
</blockquote>

Once a Dormant (Sleeper) returns from the Dream Realm they become Awakened. <br>
Their Soul Core evolves to the next rank and they gain a second Aspect Ability. <br>
At this point they are able to perceive and interact with Soul Essence. <br> 
When an Awakened goes to sleep, they enter the Dream Realm. 

<br><br>
<blockquote>
A person of a third Rank was described as Ascended, since they were rising above their human nature. <br>
A creature of the same Rank was called Fallen. This step had to do with ascension, or the opposite of it. <br>

- Sunny, Chapter 368 Aster, Song, Vale
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The Ascension was a miraculous process. It merged the physical and the spirit bodies together, taking the best parts and perfecting both. <br>
- Sunny, Chapter 746 First Steps
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Ascension is a step of rising above one's mortal nature by improving the quality of their essence, and their body as well. <br>
- Ananke, Chapter 1307 Before the Nightmare Spell
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
[The world] also responded to a few people below the Transcendent Rank... <br>
- Sunny, Chapter 1307 Before the Nightmare Spell
</blockquote>

Once an Awakened succeeds in challenging the Second Nightmare they become Ascended (Master). <br>
Their Soul Core evolves and they gain a third Aspect Ability. <br>
At this point a human rises above their human nature, thus the name 'Ascended'. <br>
Some Masters seem to have the ability to influence the world like Transcendents do, though their influence is weaker. <br>
Masters can choose to enter the Dream Realm whenever they want, but still required a Gateway to return to reality.<br>

The gap in Soul Essence amount between an Awakened and an Ascended is not too large, but the real seperator lies in the control they have over it. <br>

<br><br>
<blockquote>
A person of the fourth Rank was described as Transcendent, since they had transcended the mundane and assumed some qualities of the divine. <br>
A creature of the same Rank was called Corrupted. This step had to do with transformationâ€¦ <br>
it was no coincidence that the Aspect Ability the Saints received was called a Transformation Ability, after all. <br>

- Sunny, Chapter 368 Aster, Song, Vale
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Transcendence is different. It is not just about accumulation... it is a step of profound transformation, where a mortal assumes the first qualities of the divine. <br>
The soul essence has to become much more potent, the soul core has to become much more voluminous. <br>
Most importantly, an Awakened has to become one with the world and be recognized by it. <br>
Their soul has to be... expanded beyond the confines of the body and fused, to a small extent, with the world.<br><br>

It was like when Saint Tyris appeared and the sunlight seemed to shift a little, as if wishing to be close to her. <br>
The world itself responded to the Transcendent, and even bent to their will sometimes.<br><br>

Of course, the connection between a Transcendent and the world is not all-encompassing. <br> 
Rather, it is a connection to one or, very rarely, several aspects of the world... be it water, wind, shadow, light, or something else entirely. <br>

- Ananke, Chapter 1307 Before the Nightmare Spell
</blockquote>

When an Ascended (Master) conquers the Third Nightmare they become Transcendent (Saint). <br>
Their Soul Core evolves and they gain a Transformation Aspect Ability. <br>
At this stage of the Path of Ascension/Corruption a creature assumes the first qualities of the divine/profane. <br>
Beings of this rank are able to exert some level of control over the world.


<br><br>
<blockquote>
The next step also had a special meaning to it. It represented authority and reign. <br>
Be it Supreme or Great, beings of that level were meant to consolidate their power and exert it upon the world. <br>

- Sunny, Chapter 368 Aster, Song, Vale
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
If the Path of Ascension was the road to divinity, then each step brought those treading it closer to godhood. Transcendence was the step of breaking away from the limits of the mundane. Supremacy was the act of asserting one's power over the world, thus establishing the foundation of their future apotheosis.

But it was the next step, which no Awakened of their world had taken before, that signified truly attaining the qualities of the divine. A Sacred being was already a deity, albeit a lesser one.

The same could be said about a Cursed being. The Cursed Tyrant, Condemnation, could very well be called a deity, A profane deity of abyssal Corruption. <br>

- Nephis, Chapter 1683 Dark Deity
</blockquote>

A Transcendent becomes a Supreme (Sovereign) when they conquer the Fourth Nightmare. <br>
