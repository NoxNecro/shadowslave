title: Power System

## Introduction
I'm Nox, a fan and reader of Shadow Slave, just like you.<br>

And if _you_ are anything like _me_, then you might have run into some trouble understanding the power system of Shadow Slave, as it is as well crafted and in depth as it is hard to understand.<br>

I noticed that, as I got further and further into the novel, I relied more and more on directly being told how strong certain creatures were in comparison to our heroes. <br>

I noticed that I didn't feel the tension I was supposed to feel when sunny entered his next big fight until I was told just how strong his enemy was. <br>

It is for that reason that I have collected and summarized all important parts of the power system that have been either mentioned in the novel or by Guiltythree himself. <br>

On this page a list of events from the novels and

        "Nothing outside what's written in Shadow Slave (the novel) is canon, including the things I say in [the Q&A Channel]" - Guiltythree <br><br>
        Despite this, I still think it's fair to take his explanations for some of the 'mechanics' of the power system as the truth.

from the [discord](https://discord.gg/guiltythree) will be shown, with explanations where they are necessary. <br>

I'd also like to thank everyone in the discord for answering any of the (sometimes quite stupid) questions I had. If you have any unanswered questions by the end of this explanation, be sure to ask there! <br>

That being said, I hope this will help you as much as it did me! <br>

## Ranks vs Classes
Ranks and Classes seem, at first glance, very similar as they both increase the power of the owner, right? Well, not quite. <br>
Let's talk about Ranks, the most complicated one, first.

### Ranks
To fully understand the concept of ranks, you need to understand that for humans/nightmare creatures the purpose of becoming stronger is to reach divinity/profanity respectively. <br>
The reason for this is very important to the story, and less so for a full understanding of the power system, so I'll leave it out to avoid more spoiler tags.  <br>

For humans I'll mostly be mentioning their power in the context of the spell, instead of through the 'normal' method as that is the way (most) of our main cast grows. <br> 

The next thing you need to understand is that the Path of Ascension is a mirror of the Path of Corruption and vice versa.

|   | Ascension           | Corruption |
|---|---------------------|------------|
| 1 | Dormant (Sleeper)   | Dormant    |
| 2 | Awakened (Awakened) | Awakened   |
| 3 | Ascended (Master)   | Fallen     |
| 4 | Transcendent (Saint)| Corrupted  |
| 5 | Supreme (Sovereign) | Great      |
| 6 | Sacred (Spirit)     | Cursed     |
| 7 | Divine (God)        | Unholy     |


<blockquote>
each step of the Path of Ascension... as well as of the Path of Corruption... has its own meaning.<br>
The first path is the ascent toward divinity, while the second is the descent into profanity." <br>
- Nephis, Chapter 1073 The Fourth Step
</blockquote>

And their own meaning they have! 

<br><br>
<blockquote>
dormant quote here
</blockquote>

Sleepers are carriers of the Nightmare Spell that have passed the First Nightmare. <br> They receive the ability to perceive and interact with Soul Cores, as well as a unique Aspect and Flaw. 

<br><br>
<blockquote>
Awakening was the first step toward divinity, after all, and divinity was in direct opposition to Corruption. <br>
So, it only made sense that coming closer to divinity would render one immune to the weaker manifestation of its enemy. <br>
- Sunny, Chapter 1827 Cleansing
</blockquote>

Once a Sleeper (Dormant) returns from the Dream Realm they become awakened. <br>
Their Soul Core evolves to the next rank and they gain a second Aspect Ability. <br>
At this point they are able to perceive and interact with Soul Essence. <br> 
When an Awakened goes to sleep, they enter the Dream Realm. 

<br><br>
<blockquote>
A person of a third Rank was described as Ascended, since they were rising above their human nature. <br>
A creature of the same Rank was called Fallen. This step had to do with ascension, or the opposite of it. <br>

- Sunny, Chapter 368 Aster, Song, Vale
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The Ascension was a miraculous process. It merged the physical and the spirit bodies together, taking the best parts and perfecting both. <br>
- Sunny, Chapter 746 First Steps
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Ascension is a step of rising above one's mortal nature by improving the quality of their essence, and their body as well. <br>
- Ananke, Chapter 1307 Before the Nightmare Spell
</blockquote>

Once an Awakened succeeds in challenging the Second Nightmare they become Ascended (Master). <br>
Their Soul Core evolves and they gain a third Aspect Ability. <br>
At this point a human rises above their human nature, thus the name 'Ascended'. <br>
Masters can choose to enter the Dream Realm whenever they want, but still required a Gateway to return to reality.<br>

The gap in Soul Essence amount between an Awakened and an Ascended is not too large, but the real seperator lies in the control they have over it.

<br><br>
<blockquote>
A person of the fourth Rank was described as Transcendent, since they had transcended the mundane and assumed some qualities of the divine. <br>
A creature of the same Rank was called Corrupted. This step had to do with transformationâ€¦ <br>
it was no coincidence that the Aspect Ability the Saints received was called a Transformation Ability, after all. <br>

- Sunny, Chapter 368 Aster, Song, Vale
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Transcendence is different. It is not just about accumulation... it is a step of profound transformation, where a mortal assumes the first qualities of the divine. <br>
The soul essence has to become much more potent, the soul core has to become much more voluminous. <br>
Most importantly, an Awakened has to become one with the world and be recognized by it. <br>
Their soul has to be... expanded beyond the confines of the body and fused, to a small extent, with the world.<br>

- Ananke, Chapter 1307 Before the Nightmare Spell
</blockquote>

When an Ascended (Master) conquers the Third Nightmare they become Transcendent (Saint). <br>
Their Soul Core evolves and they gain a Transformation Aspect Ability. <br>
At this stage of the Path of Ascension a mortal assumes the first qualities of the divine. <br>
We can assume that the same goes for the Path of Corruption.

<br><br>
<blockquote>
The next step also had a special meaning to it. It represented authority and reign. Be it Supreme or Great, beings of that level were meant to consolidate their power and exert it upon the world. <br>

- Sunny, Chapter 368 Aster, Song, Vale
</blockquote>

Supreme
