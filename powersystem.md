title: Power System

## Introduction
I'm Nox, a fan and reader of Shadow Slave, just like you.<br>

And if _you_ are anything like _me_, then you might have run into some trouble understanding the power system of Shadow Slave, as it is as well crafted and in depth as it is hard to understand.<br>

Because I noticed that, as I got further and further into the novel, I relied more and more on directly being told how strong certain creatures were in comparison to our heroes. <br>

I noticed that I didn't feel the tension I was supposed to feel when sunny entered his next big fight until I was told just how strong his enemy was. <br>

It is for that reason that I have collected and summarized all important parts of the power system that have been either mentioned in the novel or by Guiltythree himself. <br>

On this page a list of events from the novels and

    <span class="excerpt-popup">
        "Nothing outside what's written in Shadow Slave (the novel) is canon, including the things I say in [the Q&A Channel]" - Guiltythree <br><br>
        Despite this, I still think it's fair to take his explanations for some of the 'mechanics' of the power system as truth.

from the [discord](https://discord.gg/guiltythree) will be shown, with explanations where they are necessary. <br>

I'd also like to thank everyone in the discord for answering any of the (sometimes quite stupid) questions I had. If you have any unanswered questions by the end of this explanation, be sure to ask there! <br>

That being said, I hope this will help you as much as it did me! <br>

## Ranks vs Classes
Ranks and Classes seem, at first glance, very similar as they both increase the power of the owner, right? Well, not quite. <br>
Let's talk about **ascension** and **descension**, or "Ascend toward divinity" and Descend toward profanity". <br>
These are the paths that humans and nightmare creatures follow respectively.
