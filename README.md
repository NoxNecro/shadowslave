I'm Nox, a fan and reader of Shadow Slave, just like you.<br>

And if _you_ are anything like _me_, then you might have run into some trouble understanding the power system of Shadow Slave, as it is as well crafted and in depth as it is hard to truly grasp.<br>

I noticed that, as I got further and further into the novel, I relied more and more on directly being told how strong certain beings were in comparison to our heroes. <br>

I noticed that I didn't feel the tension I was supposed to feel when the cast entered their next big fight until I was told just how strong their enemy was. <br><br>


This site contains a few different utilities to help you with understanding the power of both allies and enemies alike. <br>

The first is a complete recap/explanation of (just about) everything we know about the different ranks and classes in Shadow Slave. 
Here I'll show you quotes, explanations, answers to common questions and more that will hopefully help you understand the system better. <br>

The second and third are variations of the same utility; you have the choice between
<span class="excerpt-hover">
    <strong style="cursor: pointer; text-decoration: underline dotted;">[a table](https://noxnecro.github.io/shadowslave/table.html)
</strong>
    <span class="excerpt-popup">
        The table allows you set your current chapter so you don't have to worry about spoilers.
    </span>
</span>
and a [combining system](https://noxnecro.github.io/shadowslave/creature-lookup.html). <br>

Both tools allow you to combine rank and class to show you the estimated power level of the creature and, if available, notable examples of creatures with the same strength. <br><br>

I hope these tools help you as much as making them helped me.
