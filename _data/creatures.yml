      It was time to kill another Dormant Monster. <br><br> 
      'How many have I killed, already?' <br><br> 
      More than any Sleeper she knew, certainly. And more than many young Awakened in Ravenheart, as well, despite being mundane. <br><br> 
      But she still had to be extremely cautious. She couldn't allow a single mistake... it was just like how her teacher always said. One mistake was all it took to turn into a corpse.
